# Pico-y-Placa-Predictor
This is a repository to predict if a number plate can drive depending of the rules of Pico y Placa in Quito, Ecuador.

For this project I used the past rules of the Pico y Placa System. In this case the rules were:

Day Schedule: 7:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m

Afternoon Schedule: 4:00 p.m - 7:30 p.m

Monday: 1,2; Tuesday: 3,4; Wednesday: 5,6; Thursday:7,8; Friday: 9,0; Saturday and Sunday: Everyone can be on the road.

This system was developed with Java and using JUnit Test.
